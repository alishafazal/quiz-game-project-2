# UX
### Site Purpose
The purpose of this quiz game is to allow users who are intersted in science to test their general scientific knowledge, by answering a series of 10 thought-provoking science questions. 

### Audience
The target audience is for people who have a scientific background or people who have an interest in science and would like to test their knowledge.

### Communication
- As the aim was to create a fun and interactive quiz game, I wanted the overall site to reflect this. Combining blue and purple as the main background colours give the site a fun feel along with the many icons used. 
- Throughtout the site, I have used the hover selector to allow most buttons and icons to change colour upon user interaction, making the site highly interactive.
- The site displays excellent contrast through the use of black text against the coloured background. The use of Overpass and Roboto as the font further aids in user readability, as these fonts are simple and easy to follow.
- The site is intuitivley designed, allowing the user to easily make their way from start to finish, with an option to replay the game at the end if the user wishes to do so.

# Design
### Wireframes
I sketched my wireframes out by hand as it gave me more control in documenting my thoughts and design ideas

### Colour Scheme
I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) to find a colour scheme I could take inspiration from. I decided on using all three shades from the below colour palette:

When combining both #C2BBF0 and #8FB8ED together from the above palette, I felt a darker shade of purple would go better, so I used #907AD6 instead. Using blue and purple together creates a fun feel for the site and rather than using dull colours. I also decided to use blue and purple as I felt these colours (especially blue) represent the science theme nicely. To allow the black coloured text to have maximum contrast against the background shades, I used #F1E3F3 in the above palette for all button and text containers.

### Typography
All fonts were sourced from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). I chose to use Overpass as the font for the main title of "Science Quiz Game", appearing in all pages of the site and Roboto for all other text. I used these two fonts as I felt they paired well together. Both are simple and easy to read, but at the same time they add a nice styling effect and increase the visual attractiveness of the site compared to using the basic Sans-Serif font.
