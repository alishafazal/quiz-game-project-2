# UX
### Site Purpose
The purpose of this quiz game is to allow users who are intersted in science to test their general scientific knowledge, by answering a series of 10 thought-provoking science questions. 

### Audience
The target audience is for people who have a scientific background or people who have an interest in science and would like to test their knowledge.

### Communication
- As the aim was to create a fun and interactive quiz game, I wanted the overall site to reflect this. Combining blue and purple as the main background colours give the site a fun feel along with the many icons used. 
- Throughtout the site, I have used the hover selector to allow most buttons and icons to change colour upon user interaction, making the site highly interactive.
- The site displays excellent contrast through the use of black text against the coloured background. The use of Overpass and Roboto as the font further aids in user readability, as these fonts are simple and easy to follow.
- The site is intuitivley designed, allowing the user to easily make their way from start to finish, with an option to replay the game at the end if the user wishes to do so.
